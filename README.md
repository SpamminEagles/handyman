# Welcome

You are looking at my program I made to help me out. So far this is only able to contain all the words I would learn in russian,
but options, like the abbility to type cyrillic charaters into other applications are being worked on.

The application is only in alpha with limited capabilities. the WPF app was written on C# with .NET 4.6.1.
